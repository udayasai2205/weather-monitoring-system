With the advent of high-speed Internet, more and more humans around the globe are 
interconnected. Internet of Things (IoT) takes this a step further, and connects now no longer 
best human beings however digital gadgets which could communicate among themselves. 
With falling prices of Wi fi enabled gadgets this fashion will handiest collect extra momentum. 
The major idea at the back of the Internet of Things (IoT) is to attach numerous digital gadgets 
via a community after which retrieve the facts from those devices (sensors) which may be 
dispensed in any fashion, add them to any cloud provider where in you possibly can examine 
and system the accumulated information. In the cloud service one can utilize these data to 
alert people by various means such as using a buzzer or sending the mane-mail or sending 
them a SMS etc. 
As stated earlier, IoT allows now no longer simplest Human-Human interplay, however additi
onally Human Device interplay in addition to Device-Device interplay. This precise improve
ment with inside the Shape of latest avenues of interactions will affect basically each enterpri
se inclusive of transportation and logistics, energy, fitness care etc. For example, with inside t
he case of energy, IoT is being carried out to create Smart Grids that can discover and reply to
changes can detect and respond to changes in local and broader level changes in energy cons
umption, which is going to be an integral part of any nation’s energy policy broader stage mo
difications in electricity consumption, which goes to be crucial a part of any nation’s electricit
y policy. Looking past the a fore stated strength example, there are numerous regions of pursu
its wherein IoT can make A significant effect such as, Smart Homes, which contain IoT to in
tensify the diploma of automation; Wearable technology such as smart watches and health ba
nds; One of the most important regions of capability in IoT is hooked up healthcare. Many gl
obal electronics be moths have already invested deeply in the Internet of Things infrastructure

. Monitoring weather’s condition plays an extensive role in today’s ever-changing wor
ld. The impact of the state of the environment creates a number of difficulties in a var
iety of industries, including agriculture, industry, construction, and more. However, th
e estimated impact primarily affects industry and agriculture.
The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has opened new opportunities for deve
loping weather monitoring systems that can transmit data in real-time. A weather 
 monitoring system is a piece of equipment that uses several sensors to gather 
information about the weather and environment. There are two different kinds of wea
ther stations one that has its own sensors, and the other that gets its data from the s
ervers of other weather stations. Weather stations are also called weather centres 
personal weather stations, professional weather stations, home weather stations wea
ther forecaster, and forecasters. The ability to collect and analyse real-time weather 
data provides valuable information that can be used to make informed decisions 
and act accordingly.
This paper presents a real-time weather monitoring system using the Node-MCU 
which provides an affordable and reliable solution for weather monitoring.
The Node-MCU is a widely used IoT development board that can connect to the inter
net through Wi-Fi. The system developed in this paper includes various sensors 
such as thermistor to take temperature readings, a barometer to measure the atmosp
heric pressure, capacitive humidity sensor to measure humidity, rain sensor to meas
ure rainfall, and more. The collected data is transmitted in real-time to a cloud-based 
platform for storage and analysis, enabling remote access from anywhere in the worl
d. The system's hardware and software are detailed, providing a guide for replicating 
and customizing the system.
The system's performance is evaluated through experiments conducted in real-world 
 weather conditions. The results of the study show that the system can provide 
accurate and timely weather data, making it a valuable tool for various applications.
The system's accuracy and reliability are evaluated by comparing the collected data 
to official weather data sources. The system's ability to operate in various weather 

conditions is also tested, demonstrating its ability to operate in extreme weather 
conditions. Findings demonstrate that the system can deliver precise and timely 
meteorological data, making it a useful tool in monitoring weather conditions.
The study also evaluates the system's cost-effectiveness and scalability. The NodeMCU provides an affordable and reliable solution for weather monitoring, making it 
 accessible to individuals and organizations alike.
The scalability of the system is evaluated by testing the system's ability to handle a 
large number of nodes, demonstrating its ability to operate on a large scale. The 
system's remote monitoring and control capabilities are also evaluated, its ability to p
rovide real-time access to weather data from anywhere in the world.
The cloud-based platform used for data storage and analysis provides a user-friendly
interface for accessing and visualizing weather data. User can collect the 
measurements by the sensors at any time.
It can even be viewed on mobile handsets or tablet. This means that whenever user 
want to know what the temperature is, user can have access to information in real ti
me The system's hardware and software can be customized to meet specific needs 
making it suitable for various applications.
The Node-MCU based real-time weather monitoring system created in this paper offe
rs reasonable and dependable weather monitoring option. The system's accuracy 
reliability, cost-effectiveness, scalability, and remote monitoring capabilities make it 
valuable tool for various applications. The study demonstrates the feasibility and 
effectiveness of using the Node-MCU for weather monitoring, providing a foundation
for future research and development in this area such as connecting it to the satellite
as a global feature of this system.
